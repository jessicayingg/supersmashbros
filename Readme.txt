HI MS WONG

HOW TO NAVIGATE THE PROGRAM:

- Only arrow keys (all menus are navigated with left and right arrow keys, pause screen is up and down arrow keys)
- Press enter to select (pressing enter will select the box/option that is highlighted on your screen)
- To go back to previous menus OR pause the game, press the escape button

HOW TO PLAY:
- Rules are basically just the same as Smash Bros rules
	- You can double jump
	- You can jump through ledges
	- Pressing the down key once while on a ledge brings you down from that ledge


MISSING FUNCTIONALITIES:

- I was planning on doing multiple special attacks (1 up, 1 down, 1 horizontal), but I ended up only having time to do 1 special attack for each character


ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITIES: 

- Characters get knocked back horizontally and vertically a little bit after being hit (it's more realistic to the real game)
- Added some music (1 song for menu, 1 song for when fighting)
- Adding little character profiles on the bottom of the screen during the fighting part of the game (it's a bit closer to what the real game looks like)
	- Can see damage taken as a %
	- Can see number of lives each character has left


ALTERED FUNCTIONALITIES:

- Before, a settings option was to do best out of 1, 3, or 5. I changed that to being able to choose from 1-5 lives to start with. 


KNOWN BUGS/ERRORS:

- Sometimes when a character falls off the "ground", instead of being respawned at the top, they are respawned right where they just fell, fall again, and then get respawned at the top. It doesn't mess up any of the life counters, but it's weird. I don't know how to trigger it, and it doesn't happen often either. 


OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION:

- Making the graphics - I had to draw the ledges in both stages + the ground in stage 2 (ice stage) on my trackpad. I made my own graphics for every single screen in the game, except for the title screen, the backgrounds of the two stages, and the background for the winner screen. Making all the pictures in photoshop took me a lot of time :( . I cut all the sprite pictures out myself, but I didn't make those ones. 
- If you fall off the "ground" and move midair so that you touch the wall of that "ground", you clip back onto it. This isn't really a bug since it's supposed to be like how you can grab onto a ledge to get back onto it in the real game (it's just a not very graceful way of doing that)
- I tried running my program on my dad's windows laptop and it works, but the gameplay is sometimes laggy (it's not laggy at all on my laptop)
- When assigning new keys for the controls in settings, if you try to change a key to another that is already being used for a different function, nothing will happen
	- Keys not allowed at all to be assigned to functions: number keys, function keys, enter, shift, 	command/control, option/alt, caps lock, tab, grave key, escape
